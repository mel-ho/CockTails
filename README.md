# App Name: Cocktails
Deployed on Netlify : https://cocktails04082023.netlify.app/

## Background
To create a React App that helps you find cocktail inspirations using the public API https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

## Technologies Used:
- React / React Router
- HTML
- CSS

## Process:
### Getting Started:

API has a few different type of data it can fetch
- Lookup a random www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php
- List of cocktails by first letter: www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?f=a
- Search by cocktail name www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita\
- Filters by category
  - www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Ordinary_Drink
  - www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Cocktail

Given these, decided on a app that has the four functionalities
1. Random: display 1 random cocktail
2. Full Directory: list of all cocktails by alphabet
3. Filter Function: filter for cocktail types based on certain parameters (e.g. category/ ingredients / alcoholic)
4. Search Function : search by cocktail name to display 1 cocktail

- not much documentation available for this free API, so had to figure out what was the response and how to get it into the format needed
- creation of navigation bars and route paths were done used react-router
- Cocktail of the Day Page: To fetch and display a random cocktail. created a cocktail component so that it could be used subsequently if needed
- Directory: api had listings based on alphabets. made use of that to pull out the cocktails based on alphabets. useParmas was used to dynamically create the individual pages insted of creating 26 pages.
- Search: search function requires the cocktail ID and can't search with just the cocktail name. Had to use the name to search the id before being able to search out the full details of the cocktail. 
- Filter: used the various filter listings to populate the filter parameters. initially tried to filter by one parameter then the next then the next, but this kept turning and error. ended up filtering for a list for each parameter then matching each cocktail to see that they overlap in all three lists.

## Current Bugs:
- Directory: currently if there's no cocktail in the alphabet a blank page is returned (e.g. X). should put in a "no cocktails starting with this alphabet" response (UPDATE: manually removed the two alphabets from the alphabet listing)
- Filter page: fetch too much data and thus loads slowly. sometimes needs to click the submit button multiple times before a response is obtained. loading spinner would probably be a good addition here. (UPDATE: use promises to simultaneously fetch data from the 3 apis to be compared)
- Search page: if cocktail doesn't exist nothing shows. should put in a "cocktail not found" response (UPDATE: cocktail not found response added. additional feature to show 5 suggested cocktails added)

## Future improvements:
- being able to click into the cocktails for a full listing from the directory (UPDATE: this has been added) and the filter pages.
- being able to filter by ingredients
