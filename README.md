# App Name: Cocktails

### Background
To create a React App that helps you find cocktail inspirations using the public API https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

### Technologies Used:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Getting Started:

API has a few different type of data it can fetch
- Lookup a random www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php
- List of cocktails by first letter: www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?f=a
- Search by cocktail name www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita\
- Filters by category
  - www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Ordinary_Drink
  - www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Cocktail

Given these, decided on a app that has the four functionalities
1. Random: display 1 random cocktail
2. Full Directory: list of all cocktails by alphabet
3. Filter Function: filter for cocktail types based on certain parameters (e.g. category/ ingredients / alcoholic)
4. Search Function : search by cocktail name to display 1 cocktail

### Process & Challenges:
- not much documentation available for the API, so had to figure out what was the response and how to get it into the format needed
- creation of navigation bars and routes used react-router
